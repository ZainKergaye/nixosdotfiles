## Dev environments

To configure whatever environment, you can use this command:
nix flake init --template github:the-nix-way/dev-templates#java

Look at the-nix-way/dev-templates

## To implement

[ ] Sleep at 15 mins
[ ] Suspend at 1 hr

## Bugs

- [ ] See if an opened window class can stay there? Like opening steam and moving to another window
